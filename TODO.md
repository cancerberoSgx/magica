## ISSUES

- [ ]  var r = await run({     script: 'convert bluebells.png output.png',     inputFiles: [await File.fromUrl('bluebells.png')],  protectOutputFiles: true   })
- [ ]  await File.fromFile('test/assets/text2.tiff') will fail for files generated/written with this new version for some reason - I think they are written incorrectly...
- [ ] errors are silently ignored - passing non existent file name


## TODO / Road map
- [ ] move CLI to other project and remove dependencies.
- [ ] besides tools to obtain pixel color/height, add others to obtain pixel lightness, hue, strength, see bottom of http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/colorglow/index.php
- [ ] imList - convert -list auto generated enum. 
- [x] remove p-map dependency from src/image/imageBuiltIn.ts
- [ ] run(verbose: true) - propagate verbose to main() call and RunResult.
- [ ] magick command is not available, only convert, identify - but we should be using magick not those. (or is it that we are really executing magick and what we pass are its args ? ). Research.
- [ ] apps/magica-react - react components to different views of images and commands. 
- [ ] implement a monaco syntax color and autocompletion like we did in cannabis
- [ ] move examples to its own project
- [ ] test unicode chars with fonts 
- [ ] performance tests in the browser
- [ ] fix testUmdWasmLocationTest in browser test so dont break on publish
- [ ] concurrency node.js/CLI - if executed in different processes concurrently in the same folder, since working_tmp is the same will fail
- [ ] do the same as mainConcurrency for run()
- [ ] options should allow to define a different nodeJsFsRoot or emscriptenFsRoot 
- [ ] remove / replace knownSupportedReadWriteImageFormats with listFormat() - formatTest should use that.
  - [ ] listFormat() should parse read/write info too
- [ ] distribute magica as esm module (< script type"module...)
- [ ] consume input image from stream (only node.js ?)and support stdin . same for output / stdout
- [ ] I should be able to make output files protected by config.
- [ ] run() scriptListener  . finish the feature and test it or drop it
- [ ] test mkdir -p for output files   
- [ ] because options are global - sending commands concurrently could fail. Solution: queue or instance options
- [ ] an easy to use API for web-workers
- [ ] test mpeg format support
- [ ] verify web worker  passing files is optimal (verify transferable/shared array buffers/optimal)
- [ ] remove all logic from imageMagick/compiled/nodeMagick.js to separate.ts file
- [ ] should magica support running native IM executable in node if they are present ?  
- [ ] improve/test errors thrown when there's a missing file, currently it fails silently.
- [ ] document CLI options for run({script})
- [ ] in the readme document a working example of loading magica.umd.js directly from unpkg cdn
- [ ] feature: concat run(): `var r1 = await run(...) ... var r2 = await run({script, inputFiles: await File.fromResult(r1)})
- [ ] Module.onAbort()
  - [ ] abort listeners API
  - [ ] when abort use that info to build the result 
- [ ] scripts/generateImEnum.ts we should execute our CLI to extract 
- [ ] test -font companion:  -family, -stretch, -style, and -weight.
- [ ] librsvg 
  - [ ] libxml tests
  - [ ] librsvg tests
- [ ] libheif 
  - [ ] libheif tests
- [ ] API to manipulate pixels in memory - currently not possible with IM CLI-based API. 
  - [ ] integrate haxe-bitmap js API that currently reads RGBA-8bit raw bitmaps
    - [ ] probably need to support 16 bit depth too
  - why ? so we also contribute code there for cool algorithms and filters - and we already have a nice API defined
  - [ ] collect all IM commands executed when npm test  . Present that as test evidence ii n a table

## WIP

- [w] document run({script}) template, preprocessor, custom commands 
  - [w] document  script pre processors API
  - [w] document script templates infrastructure, syntax, examples, building helpers, how to add new helpers, how to add new properties to the context. 
  - [ ] document custom commands
  - [w] document run() scripts and supported syntax
- [w] test and document protected files feature
- [w] autotrace - working but currently disabled 
  - [ ] try to build from github. it's not working at all for photos and very badly for letters. it generates invalid svg (not opening in chrome)
  - [w] autotrace test


## DONE

- [x] raw library
- [x] main(verbose: true) : {..., verbose: VerboseInfo} - with output size
- [x] try to build something similar to a real time experience with canvas and IMG cache format files being careful not to remove them. User moving mouse  affects the canvas (processed with IM)

- [x] lcms - -profile icc test
- [x] lcms - -profile .icc
- [x] test cypher feature 
- [x] test mng animations

### problems descriptions:

#### a doubt about templates - do we really need two types of templates ? compile time and runtime - or just with compiled time is enough? templates:

TLDR: wr support both compile tme and tuntime templates - but in general users won't need these later. Also runtime templates require to be all the declaration in the same line of code. 
- [x] We will try to solve all scripting problems just with templates and not implement virtual commands or extra syntax since that would not be KISS. Nevertheless static templates can not accomplish all situations, in general when you meed concrete values new commands (at runtime - not a compile time) are need - templates are evaluated at compile time (For example, I want to protect imperatively one command's output file). But still we will try to solve this only with templates  so we don't have to parse any script code. The only way to support it without virtual commands is by adding event emitter in run() to protect files when they are created if needed

- [ ] two different types of templates are supported: 
    * **compile time** . These are evaluated when `run()` is called, using the script text as a whole
    
    ones evaluated at "compile time" with the ones that are evaluated at compile time - this is when the script is evaluated when you function `run()` is
- [x] ideas for script templates: 

``` 
var result = await run({script:`convert <%= await resolve('foo.png') -scale <%= width('foo.png')/2 %> output.<%=inputFiles[0].extension%>`, inputFiles: [File.resolve('y.gif')]} 
```



### crazy Ideas

 * react components  -see apps/magica-react

- [ ] https://github.com/charto/nbind/ - "easily" generate a js API accessing directly C/C++ code. Also support targeting asm.js , wasm or native. Try to make a simple API for magick++

- [?] Option for Node.js users to work/mount current directory - the tool should not copy input files just use them since are present in mount root ems

- [ ] drawing svg. is not documented and seems the official way is doing it using mvg. But... what if we convert all shapes to paths, use svgo to reduce the number to (even single ) path and use draw to draw them. syntax seems to be compatible... This way we should have yet another method of rasterize a svg, but this time to any format. I wonder what the speed is compared to other rasterize methods, if we target .ma
- [?] how high level scripts DDD can be integrated ? different project ?

- [ ] can we perform similar algorithm as geometrize with IM? this is interesting use-case since the objective is performance, reuse files so we need an api for:
  * prevent/ control file removal
  * commands to write/modify/access existing files
    two api alternatives:
       - Mode like / options - options.reuseFiles or options.preventFileRemove that wont write or remove files (user responsibility)
       - per file attribute "readonly"
           - an API to mark certain files or folders as readonly so they cannot me touched by convert commands. 
              - so i can create a folder and work there.
              - I can pass options.forceFileOverride to explicitly allow modifications by convert.
  * could start with random drawings and image compare (whole image or the local area)

 * check these: to render in CLI ?    ISOBRL	W	ISO/TR 11548-1 BRaiLle	Uses juxtaposition of 8-dot braille patterns (thus 8x2 dot matrices) to reproduce images, using the ISO/TR 11548-1 Braille encoding.
ISOBRL6	W	ISO/TR 11548-1 BRaiLle 6 dots	Uses juxtaposition of 6-dot braille patterns (thus 6x2 dot matrices) to reproduce images, using the ISO/TR 11548-1 Braille encoding.
